## CO2 Emissions Analysis in Canada (2014)
Project Introduction
This project is a data analysis and visualization endeavor focused on vehicle-specific CO2 emissions data from Canada in 2014. Using a comprehensive dataset, I performed a detailed analysis to uncover key trends and relationships between vehicle characteristics and their environmental impact. The final deliverable is a set of interactive dashboards created in Microsoft Excel that provide a clear, insightful overview of the data.

## Problem Statement
With increasing global concern over climate change, understanding the sources of carbon emissions is more critical than ever. The primary objective of this project was to analyze a dataset of new light-duty vehicles sold in Canada to answer the following questions:

# How do average CO2 emissions vary across different vehicle classes?

# What is the distribution of CO2 emissions based on fuel type?

# How do engine performance tiers (e.g., high-performance, mid-performance, entry-level) correlate with average CO2 emissions?

# Tools
Microsoft Excel: The primary tool used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

PivotTables: Utilized for data aggregation and summarization.

# Charts & Dashboards: Employed to create dynamic and professional-looking visualizations.

# Solution Approach
Data Acquisition & Cleaning: The analysis began with the raw CO2 Emissions_Canada.csv file. The dataset was loaded into Excel, and an initial review was conducted to ensure data integrity and remove any irrelevant columns.

# Data Analysis & Aggregation: To answer the defined problem statement, I used Excel's PivotTable functionality to summarize the raw data.

A PivotTable was created to calculate the average CO2 emissions for each Vehicle Class, which directly informed the bar chart visualization.

Another PivotTable was used to determine the total CO2 emissions contribution for each Fuel Type, a key component of the pie chart.

A final PivotTable aggregated the average CO2 emissions by Engine Performance tier, providing the data for the column chart.

Dashboard Creation & Visualization: The aggregated data from the PivotTables was then used to create the final dashboards.

A bar chart was created to visually compare the average CO2 emissions across different vehicle classes.

A pie chart was used to illustrate the proportional contribution of each fuel type to the total CO2 emissions.

A column chart highlighted the differences in average CO2 emissions between the various engine performance tiers.

All visualizations were combined into a single, cohesive dashboard for a comprehensive and professional presentation.
